I've been thinking about a line from the 42nd koan in the Blue Cliff Record. Layman P'ang is leaving a monastery while it's snowing and he says "Good snowflakes, they don't fall in any other place."  
<br><br>
Every snowflake is unique. Even if they had the same shape, it's only these particular snowflakes that are falling here. At the same time, a landscape covered in snow can be seen as a metaphor for the absolute. When snow covers the land everything appears the same.
<br><br>
One of the central dynamics in Zen practice and philosophy is the interplay between the absolute and the relative, sameness and difference.
<br><br>
What does this dynamic look like in our daily lives? Trying to maintain a balanced view that recognizes the snowflake and the snowfield has some benefits. It can be an antidote to to thinking too highly of yourself. After all, you are just one snowflake in a vast field. On the other hand, you should not think that you don't matter at the wider level, either. Your snowflake doesn't fall anywhere else. The goal is to have the clarity to see the relative difference while engaging the world without losing touch of the beauty and support you get from seeing the absolute.
<br><br>
I've often thought that Zen is like the improv technique where you try to follow up someone else's joke by saying: "Yes, and." You are one with everything yes, and you are unfathomably unique in your own way.
<br><br>
The difficulty here, and the reason it's called zen practice, is because it takes effort to live out these truths even after we understand them intellectually.
<br><br>
Going back to the example of Layman P'ang, we could imagine that someone about to embark on a journey in ancient China would have been utterly crestfallen to see snow falling. The snow could mean a difficult or even dangerous journey in that time. Perhaps Layman P'ang's remark about the good snowflakes was a way for him to appreciate some sublime natural beauty before his long, harrowing journey. 
<br><br>
Can you see the snowfield as being full of an incomprehensibile number of unique shapes? And at the same time see the individual snowflake as seamlessly melding with the entire field?
