-Zen is about being ok whether you get what you want or not. 
-It's about helping your Original self, not your little self. Which means helping others, who are you too. Another way to say this is that it's about authenticity. Your authentic self is one who does good things
-It's grounded in the idea that you are ALREADY ok but can still work on things. In Soto Zen there is the idea of practice-enlightenment, in other words that there's no separation between the one and the other. We start practice because we're already enlightened.

Every time something happens we are plagued with thinking about "is this good or bad for me?" Goalless zazen practice is the antidote for this because it's not good or bad for us, it's good for nothing as Sawaki would say
