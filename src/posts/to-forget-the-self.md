<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:0.85em;">"To study the Buddha Way is to study the self,<br/>
To study the self is to forget the self,<br/>
To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things" <br/> 
-Dogen Zenji, Genjokoan

<ul style="list-style-type:none;" >
    <li>You are not a "self" who is aware.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>The sense of self is just that, a sense. Not unlike hearing or seeing.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Importantly, this can be directly verified in one's meditation practice.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>This is why the "self" cannot get enlightened, any more than your hearing or seeing can.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>The sense of self arises in our awareness. In Zen this is referred to as original nature or Buddhanature. In Dzogchen it's called rigpa.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Your open awareness can't be improved upon or damaged. Recognizing this, there is nothing to do.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Furthermore, awareness has no preference between stillness and movement, so we are also free to take action when it's appropriate </li>
</ul>
