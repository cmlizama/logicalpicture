<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:0.85em;">"Not knowing is closest to the truth" - Dizang</span>

Our education and upbringing heavily emphasizes intellectual learning and having niche opinions. This has a place in Zen as well, but it's only part of the story.
Not needing to know is one of the key themes in Zen

Not knowing leads to holding our ideas more lightly and thus being less attached

No one can predict the future. And even if they could, they couldn't predict how they would react or how it would change them

Not knowing is kinder as well. When you think you really know someone or something really well, in some ways you are putting them in a box. Not knowing, or here let's say not knowing for sure, means you are giving them the freedom to present themselves in any possible way from moment to moment

Not knowing means that we rely less on our thoughts and move closer to just using our senses moment to moment

At the same time, this doesn't mean that there isn't a place for intellectual thought in Zen. After all, why else would there be so many books on Zen? (Not to mention blogs...) We can try to understand as much as possible while also remembering that this practice is "outside of words and letters" as Bodhidharma put it.

Mystery is another, perhaps friendlier way of describing not knowing. There's a classic Zen koan that asks "What was your original face before your parents were born?" We come out of mystery and return to mystery when we die, where no one knows what happens next.

Not knowing doesn't mean not appreciating. One of the reasons that nature and wildlife are so intriguing is because there's always an element of mystery to them. When we observe animals we might see glimpses of emotion like when a bird tenderly cares for their young. But at the same time we can never know what it's really like to be them.
