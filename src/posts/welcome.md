Welcome to my blog. My name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/logicalpicture">Chris</a> and you probably know me from posting pictures of birds and other wildlife online for the past few years.
I actually came to nature photography only after immersing myself in mindfulness and Zen meditation for several years prior to discovering birds.
In a way it's all been about Zen to begin with, but I haven't articulated that side of things very much. This blog is my attempt to start doing so. I plan 
on talking about Zen Buddhism, meditation, nature, and maybe some thoughts about knitting and making things. Hope you enjoy your time on this site!
