The feeling you can get from bird watching and meditation are basically the same. It's about not being separate. As Sengcan said, no inside no outside no in-between. 

One of my favorite writers on Zen, Kosho Uchiyama, once wrote that "even a tiny tulip blossoms out of the whole heaven and earth." In one sense this is literally true, because we need the environment for us to live at all. I think we can also tap into this as a felt sense as well when we settle down, either via meditation or taking a walk in the woods.
