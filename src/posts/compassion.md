Compassion bridges the barrier between self and other which promotes awakening because it dissolves the illusion of separation 
Our true nature is compassionate awareness, so practicing compassion helps get us there by showing a preview, if not gets us there immediately 
Compassion focuses the mind because it cuts through distractions. Like the time I watched rabbits eat on a cold night and it was very meditative
Compassion heals us. Shukman said that “kensho is the opposite of trauma.” Kensho is a loaded term, so we can say that connection/unity is the opposite of trauma
Compassion cuts through over intellectualizing. Instead of responding to suffering by thinking up a conceptual response, you go directly to offering support or action
Compassion grounds us to the real world. It's an antidote to nihilism
