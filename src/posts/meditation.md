title: Meditation is Stretching

<h3>{{title}}</h3>
Meditation is like calisthenics or like stretching. It's mostly about feeling physical sensations and thoughts can go in the background. Thinking is ok but it's not the primary concern. The important thing is to put thoughts in the background and physical feeling in the foreground. Usually we are in the opposite mode where we are overly focused on our thoughts and sometime we even ignore our physical feelings.

Two methods have worked for me the most.

- While walking, pretend like you are feeling the ground with your feet. Investigate the texture, sound, the slope of the ground, which part of your foot hits first, etc

- Focusing intently on any physical feelings you get from breathing. This could be in your abdomen, your ribcage, or the nostrils. This one is particularly helpful because of how “portable” it is. You are (hopefully) always breathing so it can be done any time.
