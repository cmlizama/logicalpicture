  <p><h3>Getting Warmer</h3>
<p>In winter here the crows will stream overhead by the thousands as they move closer to the city core to find a warm place to sleep for the night. Crows are smart animals but even plants will grow toward the sun without knowing intellectually what they are doing.</p>
<p>Maybe Zen practice is the same at times. We might not know intellectually what we are doing. Why we are getting up at 5am, or spending our precious free weekend just sitting and walking in silence. But just like the Crows are moving toward warmth, maybe we are being pulled by the experiences of freedom, ease, and joy that we find in Zen practice.</p>
<p>The Buddha said that the dharma is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. If we slow down and pay attention to those good feelings of warmth they might pull us further along the path.</p>
<p>Going full circle, I only got into bird watching from meditation. As I slowed down and started to look more around me, I noticed more trees, clouds, and wild animals. The warmth that pulls us forward can take many forms. It could be natural beauty, or getting along better with your family, or just feeling more at ease.</p>
<p>So pay attention as you practice to feel if you are getting warmer or colder and keep moving toward the warmth.</p>
